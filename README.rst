----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lightweight, standalone RESTful HTTP server for distributing Debian packages
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

cAPTain is a simple, lightweight HTTP server for storing and distributing
custom Debian packages around your organisation. It is designed to make it as
easy as possible to use Debian packages for code deployments and to ease other
system administration tasks.

Each cAPTain instance is a HTTP APT repo - simpy point a
``/etc/apt/sources.list`` entry at your instance for instant package
distribution!


Why use cAPTain?
----------------

 * Zero configuration -- just start uploading your packages using HTTP ``PUT``.

 * Integrates better into the Debian system over ``dpkg -i``, especially in
   automatically resolving dependencies and repository pinning.

 * Supports an arbitrary number of repositories - one cAPTain instance can keep
   your "live" and "staging" packages from each other, as well as separating
   your own backports or forks.

 * Older package versions are be automatically deleted/rotated, keeping
   repository size manageable whilst still allowing downgrades.

 * Packages are automatically GPG signed, improving security as well as
   preventing annoying warnings. Key distribution is built-in - no need to
   store your public key elsewhere.

 * No configuring heavyweight solutions such as `dak
   <https://wiki.debian.org/DakHowTo>`_ , provisioning a separate HTTP server,
   and stringing together arcane ``dpkg`` commands.


Quick start
-----------

#. Start the server with::

    $ ./captaind

#. In another terminal, upload your package::

    $ curl --upload-file my-package.deb http://127.0.0.1:3333/reponame

   .. tip::

     ``reponame`` can any arbitrary repository name. If it doesn't exist, cAPTain
     will automatically create it for you.

#. Configure your ``sources.list``::

    $ echo 'deb http://127.0.0.1:3333 reponame main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list

#. Save your cAPTain instance's GPG key::

    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:3333 > /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/server.gpg

#. Install your packages::

    $ apt-get update
    $ apt-get install my-package


Miscellaneous
-------------

Uploading multiple files
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Each upload will refresh the repository from scratch. However, you can save
some processing time for large repos by skipping refreshing the repo until the
end by POSTing to the repo URL::

    for X in *.deb; do
        curl --upload-file ${X} http://127.0.0.1:3333/reponame?refresh_repo=0
    done

    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3333/reponame

Removing versions
"""""""""""""""""

Versions are automatically rotated, but to manually remove a specific version,
first just locate and remove that file::

   $ rm /path/to/dists/reponame/.../python-bcrypt_0.4-1_amd64.deb

Then refresh that repository::

   $ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3333/reponame

Uploading via a pipe
""""""""""""""""""""

To upload using curl from a pipe, ensure you use ``--data-binary``::

   $ curl -X PUT --data-binary @- http://127.0.0.1:3333/reponame < my-package.deb

Creating a new GPG key
""""""""""""""""""""""

cAPTain ships with a dummy key for getting started quickly. To create your own
key, run::

   $ gpg --homedir=/path/to/gpg-home --gen-key
 
Choose all the defaults, making sure not to specify a passphrase.
